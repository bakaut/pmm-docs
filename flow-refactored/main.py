"""Entry point demonstrating class imports and handler usage.

This script shows how all the components come together via explicit
imports. It constructs a Config, instantiates the Handler and calls
its `handle` method with a mock event. In a real deployment, the
`handle` function would be connected to your cloud providerâ€™s
function handler.
