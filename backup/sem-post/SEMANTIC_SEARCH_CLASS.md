# SemanticSearch Class Implementation (Updated for Phrase Methods)

This document summarizes the implementation of the unified SemanticSearch class that combines functionality from add_phrase.py and phrase_initializer.py, and completely migrates functionality from the Utils class. All method names have been updated from "intent" to "phrase" for consistency.

## Overview

The SemanticSearch class provides a unified interface for all semantic search functionality, including:
- Initializing phrases from JSON files
- Adding new phrases
- Performing semantic and full-text searches

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created

1. **`semantic_search.py`** - The main SemanticSearch class implementation
2. **`example_semantic_search.py`** - Example usage of the class
3. **`example_semantic_search_mock.py`** - Example with mocks for testing
4. **`test_semantic_search_class.py`** - Unit tests for the class
5. **`test_migration.py`** - Test to verify migration from Utils class

### Removed Files

1. **`intent_initializer.py`** - Functionality completely moved to SemanticSearch class

### Updated Files

1. **`add_intent.py`** - Simplified to use the SemanticSearch class (renamed to add_phrase functionality)
2. **`utils.py`** - Removed methods that were moved to SemanticSearch class
3. **`index.py`** - Updated to use the SemanticSearch class
4. **`SEMANTIC_SEARCH.md`** - Updated documentation

## Class Interface

The SemanticSearch class provides the following methods:

```python
class SemanticSearch:
    def __init__(self, config: Config = None, logger: logging.Logger = None)
    def add_phrase(self, phrase_key: str, phrases: List[str]) -> bool
    def initialize_phrases(self, phrases_dir: str = None) -> bool
    def semantic_search_phrase(self, user_text: str, phrase_key: str, threshold: float = 0.7) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    def full_text_search_phrase(self, user_text: str, phrase_key: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    def search_phrase(self, user_text: str, phrase_key: str, threshold: float = 0.7) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
```

## Migration from Utils Class

The following methods have been completely removed from the Utils class and moved to the SemanticSearch class:

1. `parse_intents_and_create_embeddings()` - Moved to `initialize_phrases()` method
2. `semantic_search_intent()` - Moved to `semantic_search_phrase()` method
3. `full_text_search_intent()` - Moved to `full_text_search_phrase()` method

This migration provides several benefits:
- **Single Responsibility**: All semantic search functionality is now in one place
- **Simplified Dependencies**: No need to pass db_manager and llm_manager parameters
- **Better Encapsulation**: The class manages its own dependencies
- **Easier Testing**: Can be easily mocked for testing
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Shared logic between different scripts

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Initialize phrases from JSON files
python3 semantic_search.py init

# Add a new phrase
python3 semantic_search.py add greeting "Hello" "Hi" "Good morning"
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from mindset.semantic_search import SemanticSearch

# Initialize
searcher = SemanticSearch()

# Add phrase
searcher.add_phrase("greeting", ["Hello", "Hi", "Good morning"])

# Search for phrase
result = searcher.search_phrase("Hi there!", "greeting", threshold=0.7)
```

## Benefits of the Unified Class

1. **Single Responsibility** - All semantic search functionality in one place
2. **Easy Testing** - Can be easily mocked for testing
3. **Consistent Interface** - Unified API for all semantic search operations
4. **Reduced Code Duplication** - Shared logic between different scripts
5. **Better Maintainability** - Changes only need to be made in one place
6. **Improved Error Handling** - Centralized error handling and logging
7. **Simplified Dependencies** - No need to pass database and LLM managers as parameters

## Integration with Existing System

The SemanticSearch class integrates seamlessly with the existing system:
- Uses the same configuration and logging as other components
- Works with the existing DatabaseManager for storage
- Uses the same LLMManager for embeddings
- Maintains compatibility with existing scripts through simplified wrappers

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for the SemanticSearch class
- Example scripts demonstrating usage
- Mock-based testing for environments without database access
- Migration verification tests
