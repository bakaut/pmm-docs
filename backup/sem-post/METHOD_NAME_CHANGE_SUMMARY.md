# Method Name Change Summary: All "intent" methods to "phrase" methods

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes from all "intent" methods to "phrase" methods in the SemanticSearch class for better consistency and clarity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Files Updated
- **`flow/mindset/semantic_search.py`** - Renamed all methods from "intent" to "phrase"
- **`flow/mindset/test_migration.py`** - Updated tests to use new method names
- **`flow/mindset/test_semantic_search.py`** - Updated tests to use new method names
- **`flow/mindset/test_semantic_search_mock.py`** - Updated tests to use new method names
- **`MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Updated documentation
- **`docs/SEMANTIC_SEARCH_CLASS.md`** - Updated documentation
- **`docs/SEMANTIC_SEARCH.md`** - Updated documentation

### 2. Method Name Changes
- **Old Name**: `initialize_intents()` → **New Name**: `initialize_phrases()`
- **Old Name**: `add_intent()` → **New Name**: `add_phrase()`
- **Old Name**: `semantic_search_intent()` → **New Name**: `semantic_search_phrase()`
- **Old Name**: `full_text_search_intent()` → **New Name**: `full_text_search_phrase()`

## Reason for Change
The new names are more consistent with the overall purpose of the class, which is to work with phrases rather than specifically with intents. This provides better clarity and aligns with the database table name (`phrases`) and other method names in the class.

## Benefits
1. **Better Consistency**: Aligns with the class's focus on phrases rather than intents
2. **Clearer Purpose**: More accurately reflects what the methods do
3. **Consistent Naming**: Matches the database table name and other method names

## Testing Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ initialize_phrases method correctly added
- ✅ add_phrase method correctly added
- ✅ semantic_search_phrase method correctly added
- ✅ full_text_search_phrase method correctly added
- ✅ Old intent methods correctly removed
- ✅ All new phrase methods are callable

## Impact
This is a simple method name change that improves consistency and clarity without affecting functionality. All existing functionality remains the same, just with a more appropriate method name.
